I could not figure out how to make my heading and tag responsive and spend majority on trying to figure
that out. I ended up just leaving it but I made my background image and header responsive. Unfortunately I had 
Issues making a hamburger menu so I ended up leaving it. The benefits is I learned new skills and how 
to be more confident in my coding abilities since I feel much more confident in using flexbox then I did on
my last assignment.
Attributions: I got help from webfx freecodecamp and w3c school for some of my responsive design mostly my background image.
I tried getting help for the responsive header but it did not work. Free code camp helped me with linking the form to the link
at the top of the screen.
